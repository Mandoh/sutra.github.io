          <p>My name is Armando Martinez. I am 23 years old and have recently graduated from the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. Two of my three past positions have been in operations for start-ups. I feel that I will be a good fit for the position because I understand the nature and environment of a new and growing company. I understand job descriptions do not always match what I may be doing or that I may be undertaking things outside the scope of my current set of skills and that I will have to learn new things . In my past two operations positions I was responsible for multiple facets of the company all at the same time. Scheduling, organizing, resolving customer, technological and other various internal issues. I was also involved in the planning of how to grow or what to do next and how to implement new technology within the company. I am intrinsically motivated and always learning. I was recently accepted into Northwestern University's Full Stack Program and will be attending night classes at the university. The program is offered through their School of Professional Development. My past two positions ended because, as is the nature of start-ups, the companies quickly lost funding from investors or growth problems occured at a level above my position. I then completed my degree after gaining this experience and am ready to work for a new company. I decided to enter the field of medical research specifically cancer research because I have two family members battling with cancer and want to learn and help in a way that aligns with my skill set.</p>
